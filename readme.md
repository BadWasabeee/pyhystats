<h2> Information </h2>
<p> I am creating this website (python-based) using flask to check statictics of any player on a popular minecraft server run by Hypixel Studios... First, I am going to implement the Skyblock stat checker, then expand it throughout the year to capture a players stats from other gamemodes. I have no logo, and I am using a generic name. Please proceed with caution. </p>
