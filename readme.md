<h1 align="center">PyHystats</h1>
<h2> Information </h2>
<p> I am creating this website (python-based) using flask to check statistics of any player on a popular minecraft server run by Hypixel Studios... First, I am going to implement the Skyblock stat checker, then expand it throughout the year to capture a players stats from other gamemodes. I have no logo, and I am using a generic name. Please proceed with caution. </p>
<h2> To Do </h2>
<p>Properly show hypixel stats with a dropdown for each gamemode (Skyblock, Hungergames, etc) on the profile page </p>
<p>Connect to bazaar API and show prices of items on its own page</p>
<p>Show recently sold Auction items and other useful information on the Auction Page</p>
